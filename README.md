The establishment of the communication web-platform aim to encourage and support the participation of interested suppliers in GPA covered tenders, exchanges with consultants/experts in export, supply-chain, certification, legal aspects, etc. and the formation of a coalition of GPA stakeholders in Ukraine. Such a coalition would become an additional organized force to cooperate with the government for the effective Ukrainian participation in GPA covered tenders, including plurilateral and bilateral cooperation at the WTO GPA Committee.

The aim of this deliverable is to establish a new special GPA communication platform in Ukraine integrated with the national eProcurement System ProZorro.
